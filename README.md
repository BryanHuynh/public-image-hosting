# Public Image Hosting

This is my first full-stack react project using the React framework.

This website will host images uploaded by users publicly. These images are stored on a mongoDB server.

## Configuring mongoDB Server

To run this project you'll need your own <mark>MongoDB collection</mark>.

to connect the project to your collection create a <mark>.env</mark> file in the <mark>server folder</mark> with your <mark>api key</mark>.

example `api_key = |your api key here|`

# Install

run `npm install` in both the client and server folder

# Run

using 2 terminals use `npm start` on the server and on the client.

<mark>Server</mark> will be hosted on http://localhost:5000

<mark>Client</mark> will be hosted on http://localhost:3000

# Website

The site is deployed on netlify at: https://public-image-hosting.netlify.app/vv
